Pictures. The film was directed by John Lasseter from a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, Lasseter, Joe Ranft, Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin, 
and Jorgen Klubien and a story by Lasseter, Ranft, and Klubien, and was the final film independently produced by Pixar after its

Marin, Michael Wallis, George Carlin, Paul Dooley, Jenifer Lewis, Guido Quaroni, Michael Keaton, Katherine Helmond, John Ratzenberger 
and Richard Petty, while race car drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr. (as "Junior"), Mario Andretti, Michael Schumacher and car enthusiast Jay 
Leno (as "Jay Limo") voice themselves.Cars premiered on May 26, 2006 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina and was 
theatrically released in the United States on June 9, 2006 to generally positive reviews and also received commercial success, 
grossing $462 million worldwide against a budget of $120 million. It was nominated for two Academy Awards including Best Animated 
Feature, but lost to Happy Feet (but won both the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated 
Feature Film). The film was released on DVD on November 7, 2006 and on Blu-ray in 2007. The film was accompanied by the short One Man 
Band for its theatrical and home media releases. The film was dedicated to Joe Ranft, the film's co-director and co-writer, who died 
in a car crash during the film's production.The success of Cars launched a multimedia franchise and a series of two sequels and 
two spin-offs produced by Disneytoon Studios, starting with Cars 2 (2011).</p></div>

    <h2>Cars 2</h2>
    <p>Cars 2 is a 2011 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios 
        for Walt Disney Pictures. It is a sequel to 2006's Cars and the second film in the Cars franchise. 
        This was the final Pixar film animated with their old system, Marionette. In the film, race car 
        Lightning McQueen and tow truck Mater head to Japan and Europe to compete in the World Grand Prix, 
        but Mater accidentally becomes sidetracked with international espionage. In the film's 
        ensemble voice cast, Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Guido Quaroni, Bonnie Hunt, 
        and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles from the first film. Paul Newman, who voiced Doc Hudson 
        in the previous film, died in September 2008, so his character was written out of the film, while 
        George Carlin, who previously voiced Fillmore, died during the same year, so his role was passed 
        to Lloyd Sherr. The returning cast is joined by Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, Eddie 
        Izzard, and Thomas Kretschmann, who voice the new characters introduced in this film. It was directed 
        by John Lasseter, written by Ben Queen, and produced by Denise Ream. Cars 2 was released in the United States on June 24, 2011. The film was presented in Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D, as well as traditional two-dimensional and IMAX formats.[7] The film was first announced in 2008, alongside Up, and Brave, and it is the 12th animated film from the studio.[8][9] Despite the fact that the film received generally mixed to negative reviews from critics, it grossed $562 million worldwide. A sequel, Cars 3, was released on June 16, 2017.</p>
